Ghost have [stated][1] that they'll be doing frequent releases in future.

Webfaction have [stated][2] that their one-click installers will always be that (installers, not upgraders).  Fair enough.

This is way to get the best of both worlds, and am looking for feedback.  Anyone else up for giving this a go?

Since ghost can operate as an npm module, create one of Webfactions node.js 1-click installers and then, in webapps/<app>, add a package.json and an index.js.
